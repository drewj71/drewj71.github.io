            <p>
                I'm currently a junior at University of Michigan Dearborn pursuing a Bachelor of Science
                in Computer Information Science. My coursework has provided me with a strong foundation
                in a variety of programming languages and technical concepts. Outside of academics, I enjoy
                cooking, working out, running, and reading. I'm eager to leverage my skills and experiences
                to pursue a career in Software Engineering.

            <h3>Stock Market Simulator - C++</h3>
            <p>
                A console based program utilizing key data structures, including a node structure
                for a complete binary tree, and a min heap with priority queues. Implemented 
                functionality of insertion, removal, and updating operations in a binary tree. 
                Maintained the min heapstructure with <em>heapify</em> functions. All functions 
                managed to run in logarithmic time.

                fundamentals like variables, arrays, objects, loops, functions, the DOM and more. You'll also 
                learn about Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming, algorithmic thinking, 
                how to work with local storage, and how to fetch data using an API.

            <h3><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/ajenks71/responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design</a></h3>
            <p>
                In this Responsive Web Design Certification, you'll learn the languages that developers use to 
                build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) 
                for design. First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you'll 
                learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility 
                by building a quiz site. Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen 
                sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox, and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid.
