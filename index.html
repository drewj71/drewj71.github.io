                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm currently a junior at University of Michigan Dearborn pursuing a Bachelor of Science
                    in Computer Information Science with a concentration in Computer Science. From a young age
                    I was always fascinated by computers. I was always interested in how things worked, this 
                    came from my father who is an electrical engineer. He would show me how to fix and engineer 
                    everything around the house, and I loved his intuitive and innovate mindset. This inspired
                    me to want to learn everything about computers. I built my own first computer with my dad
                    and went on to build a few more for friends. After that I discovered programming and instantly
                    became intrigued in how to learn everything about it. I'm very passionate, motivated, and
                    determined whenever I discover a new challenge or aspect of Computer Science.

                    My experience with operating systems is fluent with Windows and Mac OS. I am currently working
                    on learning more Linux through using my RaspberryPI. The development languages that I am proficient
                    in are C/C++, .NET Development (C#), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Blazor, and React. Take a look at some 
                    of the projects that I have finished or currently working on below!
